# Go Generics: A Deep Dive

## Objective
This example provides a practical guide to **Generics**, a powerful feature introduced in Go 1.18. It demonstrates how to write type-safe, generic functions that can operate on values of any type, reducing code duplication and improving flexibility.

## What are Generics?

Generics allow you to write a single function or data structure that can work with a variety of types. This is achieved by using **type parameters**.

### Example 1: Generic Function with `any`

The simplest form of a generic function uses the `any` constraint. `any` is an alias for `interface{}`, meaning the function can accept a value of absolutely any type.

```go
// T is a type parameter that can be any type.
func getLastElement[T any](s []T) (T, error) {
    // ...
}
